## Installation

To install Usergroup Field, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `usergroupfield` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/quebecstudio/usergroupfield.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require quebecstudio/usergroupfield`
